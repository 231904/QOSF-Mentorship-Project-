In this repository you can find all files related to the Quantum Computing mentorship program. It contains:
<p> - My work during the program</p>
<p> - The selection task  (Task 4 - Random Circuits). It is structured on different sections: the generation and calling of the random_circuit function, followed by two different approaches for the Bonus part, one where the initial depth is modified after the transpilation process, thus allowing the user to experiment what changes in depth appear due to different gates, and one where the depth stays the same - set by the user.</p>
